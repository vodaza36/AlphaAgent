      "hypothesis": "Residual momentum -- the component of past returns orthogonal to market beta -- decays significantly slower than raw price momentum and avoids the long-term reversal that plagues conventional momentum strategies. Quantpedia and Blitz et al. show that ranking stocks on 12-month residual returns (standardized by residual volatility) produces risk-adjusted profits roughly twice those of total-return momentum, with only half the volatility and a monthly Sharpe ratio of 0.48 vs 0.25. We hypothesize that constructing a volatility-normalized, volume-confirmed residual trend signal -- where the residual is approximated by regressing returns against a cross-sectional mean proxy and the signal is amplified when volume trend aligns with price trend -- will generate decay-resistant alpha in the S&P 500 universe. This approach exploits the finding from Baltussen et al. (2026) that firm-specific momentum is robust across 150 years of data and is less susceptible to crowding-driven decay.",
