      "hypothesis": "Recent research on order flow imbalance demonstrates mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics with extreme kurtosis and persistent autocorrelation decay in equity markets (arXiv:2505.17388, 2025). This occurs because order flow imbalances create temporary price dislocations that systematically revert as liquidity providers absorb inventory shocks. Combining volume-price correlation patterns with cross-sectional commonality (as shown in arXiv:2505.08180 with R² improvements of 2.4x) can identify stocks where order flow mean-reversion is strongest, particularly when volume spikes coincide with extreme price-volume decorrelation periods indicating liquidity stress.",
      "direction_string": "Stocks with high volume-price decorrelation combined with recent volume spikes exhibit predictable mean-reversion as order flow imbalances systematically unwind when cross-sectional liquidity commonality returns to equilibrium.",
